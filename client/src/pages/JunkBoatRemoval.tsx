    question: "Can I take care of the junk boat removal myself?",
    answer: "Yes, it’s possible—but junk boat removal is often more challenging than it appears. Boats contain hazardous materials, metal components, electrical systems, and fluids that must be properly removed and disposed of according to regulations. In addition, fiberglass hulls must be cut and shredded using specialized equipment. Without the right tools, permits, and experience, the process can be time-consuming, costly, and unsafe. That’s why many owners choose professional removal to ensure everything is handled legally and responsibly",

    question: "What if my boat contains hazardous materials?",
    answer: "All hazardous materials are managed according to environmental regulations to ensure safe and proper disposal",

    id: "faq-3",
    question: "Do I need a title to remove junk boat?",
